Visual Vibrance is an attempt at recreating the upcoming "Vibrant Visuals" feature which is currently only available on the Bedrock edition of Minecraft.

Visual Vibrance is _an alpha_ and since it was forked from my other pack, [Glimmer](https://modrinth.com/shader/glimmer-shaders) in a relatively short period of time, there may be bugs. You can report these to me in [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/4U3nPxTznF) or `#jbritains-shaderpacks` in [the shaderLABS Discord Server](https://discord.gg/RpzWN9S).

## Compatibility

- OpenGL 4.3+ - macOS is _not_ supported, nor is the Raspberry Pi. Most modern GPUs (integrated or dedicated) should work fine.
- Iris 1.8+, OptiFine is _not_ supported.

If you are interested in contributing or assisting in the development of this shaderpack, don't hesitate to make a pull request, as I have only some interest in maintaining this pack, and it was mainly made just to see if I could recreate the look.
