Visual Vibrance is an attempt at recreating the upcoming "Vibrant Visuals" feature which is currently only available on the Bedrock edition of Minecraft.

**Warning:** *This shaderpack does not include normal maps for water.* To properly recreate the look, I recommmend a pack like [Fire Rekindled](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/fire-rekindled).

Visual Vibrance is *an alpha* and since it was forked from my other pack, [Glimmer](https://modrinth.com/shader/glimmer-shaders) in a relatively short period of time, there may be bugs. You can report these to me in [my Discord server](https://discord.gg/4U3nPxTznF) or `#jbritains-shaderpacks` in [the shaderLABS Discord Server](https://discord.gg/RpzWN9S).

# To-do
These are some things I still need to add
- Integrated water normal maps
- Caustics
- Volumetric fog and water

## Compatibility
- OpenGL 4.3+ - macOS is *not* supported, nor is the Raspberry Pi. Most modern GPUs (integrated or dedicated) should work fine.
- Iris 1.6+, OptiFine is *not* supported.

If you are interested in contributing or assisting in the development of this shaderpack, don't hesitate to make a pull request, as I have only some interest in maintaining this pack, and it was mainly made just to see if I could recreate the look.
